# HTML-Collection
A collection of HTML pages I made during learning HTML

## Context
I made this a few years ago and it was one of the first pieces of code I wrote, so please be gentle when reading the code. Also, the index.html used to be a PHP file embedded into the elidragon website - when making the repository I renamed it, but otherwise I want to preserve the code.
